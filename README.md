# React + Vite

if what we want is to dynamically display, group and sort these fish,
then we need to store the data in a format that optimizes for that.
What kind of data structure would be useful here?

We either make the data large enough to hold every representation of the data,
grouped, sorted, etc.

Or make the data very easy to sort and group.

What is every representation of the data?

- Always grouped by four distinct seasons

Within each season there are three more categories to group and sort by:

- Weather, Time and Location

Are these filters to use or ignore?

How should each group be sorted?

Or should each location be grouped to weather and then within that
sort the locations?

Having the option to only group by Location should be an option.

Have sunny/ any weather group
and a rainy group
